# MaizeLeafDisease-Kandahar-HybridData-MaxViT

This repository contains a hybrid dataset for maize (corn) leaf disease classification in Kandahar. It combines PlantVillage public data with field-collected data (with and without background). The dataset and experimental results are used to train, evaluate, and test the MaxViT deep learning model for automatic maize leaf disease detection.

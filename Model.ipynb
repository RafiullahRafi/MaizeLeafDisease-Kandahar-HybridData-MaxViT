This repository contains the MaxViT-based deep learning model and the combined maize (corn) leaf disease dataset,-
- which includes both PlantVillage and field-collected images.

The MaxViT architecture was fine-tuned using advanced augmentation techniques-
- and evaluated across training, validation, and test splits to ensure robust performance in real-world conditions.

🔹 Model: MaxViT (Tiny RW 224)

🔹 Frameworks/Libraries: PyTorch, timm, albumentations, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

🔹 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
